    <h2>Description</h2>

    <p>When summer squash season rolls around and you need a way to use up your yellow squash bounty, 
        what better dish to make than a creamy, cheesy, and buttery squash casserole?</p>
    <p>The Southern classic combines fresh squash and onion 
        with a creamy sauce and a crunchy cracker-Cheddar cheese topping.</p>
