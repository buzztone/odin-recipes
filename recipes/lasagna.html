    <h2>Description</h2>

    <p>This is my mom's special homemade lasagna recipe with a meaty, 
        made-from-scratch tomato sauce and a deliciously cheesy filling.</p>
    <p> A more traditional homemade lasagna filling would be made with ricotta 
        but my mom's recipe calls for a blend of small-curd cottage cheese and Parmesan.</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>

    <ul>
        <li>½ pound ground pork, ½ pound lean ground beef</li>
        <li>½ cup minced onion, 1 clove garlic, crushed,  1 ½ teaspoons dried basil</li>
        <li>1 (28 ounce) can crushed tomatoes, 1 (8 ounce) can tomato sauce</li>
        <li>1 (16 ounce) package lasagna noodles, 1 pound small-curd cottage cheese, 1 (16 ounce) package shredded mozzarella cheese</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h3>Steps</h3>

    <ol>
        <li>Combine pork and ground beef in a large, deep skillet over medium-high heat; cook and stir until browned and crumbly, 5 to 7 minutes. 
            Add onion and cook until translucent, about 5 minutes.</li>
        <li>Stir in crushed tomatoes, tomato sauce, 1 tablespoon fresh parsley, garlic, basil, salt, oregano, and sugar. Reduce heat to medium-low 
            and simmer, stirring occasionally, for 30 minutes.</li>
        <li>While the sauce is simmering, bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook lasagna noodles in the boiling water, stirring occasionally, 
            until tender yet firm to the bite, 8 to 10 minutes. Drain and set aside.</li>
        <li>Assemble lasagna: Spread a spoon or two of sauce over the bottom of a 
            9x13-inch baking dish just to to coat it. Place two layers of noodles 
            over the sauce to cover. Layer with 1/2 of the cheese mixture, 1/2 of the 
            remaining sauce, and 1/2 of the mozzarella cheese. Repeat layers once more 
            using the remaining noodles, cheese mixture, sauce, and mozzarella. 
            Cover the baking dish with aluminum foil.</li>
        <li>Bake in the preheated oven for 30 to 40 minutes. Remove the foil and bake until cheese is golden brown, 5 to 10 more minutes.</li>
    </ol>
